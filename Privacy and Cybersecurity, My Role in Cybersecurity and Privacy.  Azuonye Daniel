 

Privacy and Cybersecurity: My Role in Cybersecurity and Privacy. 

In our interconnected world, privacy and data security are key topics that influence individuals, businesses, governments, and society as a whole. 

So, my place in society is in a community. As stated in our discussion A community is basically A group of people with a common characteristics or interest living together within a larger society. Some examples of a community would be a phone.  

In relation to Privacy and cybersecurity a phone is a community but a phone manufacturing company like Apple or Samsung could be a society depending on what type of phone you have. 

Why privacy and data protection are important is because it allows us to have Anonymity for example, like in class you stated that some people like to go to illegal websites to buy illegal drugs and artillery and that is why they use stuff like a VPN (Virtual Private Network). Now I don't go to illegal websites but let's say I wanted to watch a movie from a website and the website is banned or it is not used in my Country/area. It would be nice to have privacy to get to my desired website using a VPN so no one can track my whereabouts. Also stuff like cyberattacks, when I am using Wi-Fi especially public Wi-Fi networks like cafes and airports having privacy in using a VPN would make me less likely prone for hackers to track my online activities and location. 

Lastly privacy could prevent stuff like throttling, although you did not clearly state this in our discussion or maybe you did, I dozed off in some parts SORRY, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) could slow down your data or internet speed after a data limit from watching too much videos or playing too much games but with privacy or a VPN you could prevent this by hiding your traffic. Basically, hiding what you do online from your Internet Service Provider. 

You remember what you said about Apple taking people's data from them using their watches. It sounded weird and creepy that that is what they do especially when you said they know when people are using the washroom or having sex. But there was a good side to it for example you said that the taking of data and location was good for stuff like Enhanced GPS and Navigation or Health and Fitness tracking like when you told us about that company in the US that made sure that all their employees wore the watch so they could track their health level and how healthy they are so as to see when they get a raise or something they don't call sick or so they don't call in sick as a lie to get out from work (Like what you did as a teen) But don't worry Mr. Warren I would have done the same thing in that scenario. Another one we discussed about was Improved User Experience and Personalized Recommendations. 

 

 Governments, Communities, and Businesses influence privacy and security in society in a good/bad way, let me explain: 

 As you may know there are people who go to illicit websites for example Silk Road to buy illicit substances well the Government could just find whoever is buying it by going to the suspects DNS server (Domain Name Service server) and then finding their VPN which may bring them closer to their suspect and make them catch the right person saving countless lives e.g. saving the people who buy the drugs from getting an overdose and saving people from holding weapons for no reason because you never know what someone with a weapon can do. But the downside is that the Government could misuse your personal data invading your privacy.  

Now for businesses, well let’s say you like watching specific content well businesses can give you advertisements to suit your needs, while this can be creepy and unsettling at times it is also very convenient. A downside could be that businesses can collect and store vast amounts of personal data about you without you fully realizing it, potentially selling that data, or using it in ways that feel invasive.  

Now lastly Community, for example, let’s say you're part of an online community focused on a hobby or interest. This community can make you feel like you belong and can offer helpful support, but it might also pressure you to share personal details or do things you might not be comfortable with. If everyone in the group is sharing personal stories, photos, or even where they live, you might feel like you must do the same just to fit in, even though it could affect your privacy.  On the other hand, the community can be a great place where people look out for each other’s safety. If someone spots a security issue or a potential privacy risk, they might warn others to keep everyone safe and informed. 

We live in a digital society and in living in this society it is crucial to know that cybersecurity and privacy shape our vision for example in our devices like phones, or Laptops we have important information like our Passwords, Account information, even our private documents and we need Privacy to be able to keep our personal information safe from hackers, scammers and phishers as you may know Privacy is not something that people are  merely entitled to, it’s an absolute requirement. Said by Marlon Brando a famous American actor in his time. Also, if by any chance people do not know how to keep their stuff private, we could teach them cybersecurity as you may know cybersecurity is the process of protecting networks, devices, programs, and data from attacks, thefts, damages, modifications, or unauthorized accesses.
